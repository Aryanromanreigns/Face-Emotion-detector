# 😀 Facial Emotion Recognition

## Motivation
Emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly important in human-computer interactions.  
Systems that can detect and respond to user emotions enhance experiences in areas like mental health, online learning, and adaptive media systems.  

This project focuses on building a **real-time facial emotion detection system** using a webcam.  
Based on the detected emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised), the system can trigger relevant actions such as playing music, showing motivational content, or providing adaptive responses.

## Project Goals
- Implement **real-time face & emotion detection** using a webcam  
- Classify facial expressions using **pre-trained CNN models** (FER-2013 dataset)  
- Trigger actions based on emotions (e.g., play music, show motivational quotes)  
- Achieve **fast and accurate classification** suitable for real-time use  

---

## Project Approach
The project primarily uses **Python** with the following technologies:

- **Face Detection & Webcam Input** → OpenCV  
- **Emotion Classification** → CNN models with TensorFlow/Keras (trained on FER-2013)  
- **Additional Libraries** → DeepFace, FaceRecognition (for accuracy testing & benchmarking)  
- **Media Control** → PyGame or YouTube API (to play music or display quotes)  
- **Real-Time Processing** → Optimized inference for minimal lag

## Dataset
We used the **FER-2013 dataset** for emotion classification.  

📌 Download dataset:  
- [FER-2013 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)  
- [Alternative Facial Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/facial-emotion-recognition)  

👉 Once downloaded, extract the dataset into a folder called `images/` inside your project directory:

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** → Face detection & webcam input  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** → CNN model for emotion recognition  
- **DeepFace** → Accuracy testing & benchmarking  
- **PyGame / YouTube API** → Media control based on emotions  

---

## Project Outcome
By the end of this project, we achieve:  
✅ A functional **real-time emotion recognition system**  
✅ **Webcam-based** face detection & classification  
✅ **Emotion-triggered** media control (music & motivational content)  
✅ A well-documented & modular codebase for contributors

## 📸 Example Usage
- Run the program → webcam starts  
- Model detects face & predicts emotion in real-time  
- System responds (e.g., plays happy music if you smile 😃)
